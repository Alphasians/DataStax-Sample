Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites
Let's do some initial setup by creating a serverless(!) database.

### DataStax Astra

1. Create a [DataStax Astra account](https://astra.datastax.com/register?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=UTM_CODE) if you don't already have one:

2. On the home page. Locate the button **`Create Database`**

3. Locate the **`Get Started`** button to continue

4. Define a **database name**, **keyspace name** and select a database **region**, then click **create database**.

5. Your Astra DB will be ready when the status will change from *`Pending`* to **`Active`** ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

6. After your database is provisioned, we need to generate an Application Token for our App. Go to the `Settings` tab in the database home screen.

1. Select `Admin User` for the role for this Sample App and then generate the token. Download the CSV so that we can use the credentials we need later.

## Quick Start
1) Create a new repository from this project using the `Use Template` button.
2) Delete the template specific files and folders: `SAMPLE_APP_CONTRIBUTING.md`, `screenshots`.
3) Fill out the `README.md` and `INSTRUCTIONS.md` files while following the directions (in comments) within.
4) Fill out the `astra.json` file with the pertinent values from your `README.md`
5) Ping the #sample-apps team to review your app and go through the publishing process.

1. After you have your Application Token, head to the database connect screen and copy the connection information that we'll need later. We'll replace `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN` with the `Token` value that is part of your Application Token.

When connecting with a secure bundle, use the service account steps below
--->
1. After you have your Application Token, head to the database connect screen and select the driver connection that we need. Go ahead and download the `Secure Bundle` for the driver.

9. Make note of where to use the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` that is part of the Application Token that we generated earlier.

### Github
<!-- Enter your GITHUB_URL below -->
1. Click `Use this template` at the top of the [GitHub Repository](GITHUB_URL):

2. Enter a repository name and click 'Create repository from template':

<!--- 
Include locally as a minimum so that folks will
create an Astra DB and use your repository as a template.

Remove paths that you don't need.
